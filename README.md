# MarketPlace Plugin

## üìå About the Plugin

MarketPlace is a plugin for Spigot 1.20.4 servers that allows players to list, sell, and buy items on the market. It has integration with MongoDB to store player data, item listings, and transaction history. As an alternative to MongoDB, MySQL can also be used with a Redis cache system.
